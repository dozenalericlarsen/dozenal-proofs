## Abstract

On the **base-12 (dozenal) Cartesian plane**, geometric constructions reveal regular polygons and tiling patterns that are *exact* due to 12's rich divisor set (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12). This work proves the existence of a **24-sided regular polygon (icositetragon)** with vertices at rational dozenal coordinates—impossible to express exactly in base-10 without irrational numbers.

This discovery exposes a **base-dependent geometric bias** in standard mathematics and suggests new avenues in crystallography, quantum lattice models, and number-theoretic geometry.


## Implications

- **Physics:** Lattice models in base-12 may simplify quantum spin systems.
- **Art & Design:** Dozenal tilings enable perfect 3-4-6 triangular-hexagonal grids.
- **Education:** Base-10 obscures natural symmetries; dozenal reveals them.
