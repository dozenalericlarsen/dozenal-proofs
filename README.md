## Abstract

On the **base-12 (dozenal) Cartesian plane**, a regular 24-gon closes exactly under 15° rotations due to dozenal-rational trigonometric values. This reveals geometric structures invisible in base-10 and enables perfect 360° circle division via discrete units.


## Implications

- **Physics:** Lattice models in base-12 may simplify quantum spin systems.
- **Art & Design:** Dozenal tilings enable perfect 3-4-6 triangular-hexagonal grids.
- **Education:** Base-10 obscures natural symmetries; dozenal reveals them.
